Repository for the building a simpler face detection library.


This library is built with a dependency on GPUImage for ease of setting up camera capture and display. Many thanks to Brad Larson for all the work he's done on that library!

Sample project gives an example of how to setup the detector to detect Faces, Face Metadata Objects, or Machine Readable Code objects such as QR Codes, and UPC Codes.
